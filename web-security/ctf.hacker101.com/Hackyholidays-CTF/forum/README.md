The Grinch thought it might be a good idea to start a forum but nobody really wants to chat to him. He keeps his best posts in the Admin section but you'll need a valid login to access that!


## phpmyadmin

## github-leak-password
git commit history reveals password of "forum"  
`forum/6HgeAZ0qC9T6CQIqJpD`

## user
login to phpmyadmin, get the user table and find admin user `grinch` and its password's md5 hash.  
look up the md5 hash on `https://md5.gromweb.com/?md5=35D652126CA1706B59DB02C93E0C9FBF`, get the password.  
  
then, login to forum and visit the admin post.
